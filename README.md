## Introduction
This project develops an object detection solution with adaptive variable receptive fields specifically optimized for the VisDrone219 dataset characteristics. The following peacture shows the architecture of VRF-DETR.

Our algorithm is primarily built upon the Ultralytics open-source toolbox compatible with PyTorch 1.13+.

The core model implementation is located in ultralytics/nn/extra_models/, while training/testing configuration files can be found in ultralytics/cfg/default.yaml.

## Installation
First create and activate a virtual environment:
```shell
conda create --name XXX python=3.8.16 -y
conda activate XXX
```
Install PyTorch and CUDA compatible with your system:
```shell
conda install pytorch==1.13.1 torchvision==0.14.1 cudatoolkit=11.7 -c pytorch
```
Install mmcv and mmengine using OpenMMLab's mim:
```shell
pip install -U openmim
mim install mmcv==2.1.0
mim install mmengine==0.9.0
```

When using an older GPU, you need to check the computing power of your GPU, and select the CUDA version and Pytorch version that meet the corresponding mmcv and mmengine requirements based on the computing power. At the same time, you should also pay attention to the correspondence between the CUDA version and the Pytorch version.

The corresponding query document link is as follows:

[GPU computing power query](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus)

[The correspondence between GPU computing power and CUDA version](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/tesla/drivers/index.html#cuda-arch-matrix)

Note: This project cannot use an older version of mmcv, and the mmcv version should be greater than 2.0. Different versions of the documentation can be selected in the black box in the lower left corner of the documentation provided by this link. Please carefully follow the above instructions to check your GPU version and install it.
